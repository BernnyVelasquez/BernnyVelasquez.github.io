THis is my first attempt at using html & CSS. Many organizational issues and misuse of code in many places. I tend to come back to make this code 
much neater. 

GOALS:
1. Make website responsive
2. add a thank you page once send button is click in contact div
3. Make code neater & more oragnized.
4. Correct the misuse of tags in the index.html
